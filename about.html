        Howdy! I’m Justin. And I’m in charge of this here project. As long as you understand that then things are going to be a OK! I’m what you call a senior person here at Lambda school and I help all the struggling students with their problems. I have done a lot on this project, but mostly I coordinate everything to make sure things go nice and smoothly. I’m from the cold part of New York.

        My name is Luis. I am responsible for the Features page. I have been coding since forever. Life is great. I love Spain, code, League of Legends, Linux, football (not American football, the real kind), Lambda School and my family…not necessarily in that exact order.

  If there is something worth imagining then I am the first to enjoy the company of a new odyssey into deep creativity. This is my credo and why I do what I do. I love art (especially complex, busy pieces) and unique perspectives on life. The page you are reading right now is what I am responsible for.

  Heyo! Ray here. There is so much to say about me that I am almost at a loss for words. What I can tell you is that I do the React in this house. Been coding here at lambda for a good bit after I got out of the service and decided to make a new life for myself. If you need anything, just ask!

  Once upon a time there was an empty github… And then I showed up and filled it with code. The end. Actually? The beginning… Now I do development like no ones business. I did the react on this project. And I am going to Lambda the heck out of this course and make serious cash money when I land a senior dev role at Google. Holla to Western NY.

  Welcome to Pintereach! I am a Full Stack Web Developer at Lambda student.  I'm learning a new skill in computer programming as I am ready to re-join the workforce after retirement from a medical field career.

  I HATE tacos. But I love design, code and the Big Apple. I did the design and frontend react for this wonderful web app. I’ve lived in The City long enough to find something out. There is a saying that is true…Every New Yorker seriously believes deep down that anyone living anywhere else must be, in some sense, kidding.
