        My name is Luis. I am responsible for the Features page. I have been coding since forever. Life is great. I love Spain, code, League of Legends, Linux, football (not American football, the real kind), Lambda School and my family…not necessarily in that exact order. </p><br /></div>

  If there is something worth imagining then I am the first to enjoy the company of a new odyssey into deep creativity. This is my credo and why I do what I do. I love art (especially complex, busy pieces) and unique perspectives on life. The page you are reading right now is what I am responsible for.

  Heyo! Ray here. There is so much to say about me that I am almost at a loss for words. What I can tell you is that I do the React in this house. Been coding here at lambda for a good bit after I got out of the service and decided to make a new life for myself. If you need anything, just ask!

  Once upon a time there was an empty github… And then I showed up and filled it with code. The end. Actually? The beginning… Now I do development like no ones business. I did the react on this project. And I am going to Lambda the heck out of this course and make serious cash money when I land a senior dev roll at Google. Holla to Upstate NY.

  Welcome to Pintereach! I am a Full Stack Web Developer at Lambda student.  I'm learning a new skill in computer programming as I am ready to re-join the workforce after retirement from a medical field career.   Let me know if you need anything else or would if you like to add or have me add more. Thanks!

  I HATE tacos. But I love design, code and the Big Apple. I did the design and frontend react for this wonderful web app. I’ve lived in The City long enough to find something out. There is a saying that is true…Every New Yorker seriously believes deep down that anyone living anywhere else must be, in some sense, kidding.
